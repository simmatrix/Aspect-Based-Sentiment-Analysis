Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed as a vital task both from an academic and a commercial standpoint. The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect the overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, regardless of the entities mentioned (e.g., laptops, restaurants) and their aspects (e.g., battery, screenÍ¾ food, service). By contrast, this task is concerned with aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), where the goal is to identify the aspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. Datasets consisting of customer reviews with human authored annotations identifying the mentioned aspects of the target entities and the sentiment polarity of each aspect will be provided.

In particular, the task consists of the following subtasks:
- Subtask 1: Aspect term extraction
- Subtask 2: Aspect term polarity
- Subtask 3: Aspect category detection
- Subtask 4: Aspect category polarity

## Datasets Used:

We used the datasets from SemEval 2016 ABSA datasets for restaurant reviews.

## Steps:

1) Download stanford-corenlp suite from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rk3901gi9l50d54/AACrT_RwI84HWFfclrRTTkVNa?dl=0
    This should be kept in the same folder as the project.
2) Run corenlp.py
3) Run client.py
    The program uses absa--test.xml as the test dataset.
4) Run aspect_term_extarctor.py
    This extracts all the aspect terms from each review in the test file.
5) Run pol.py
    This calculates the polarities of the aspect terms.
6) Run categorizer.py
    This places all the aspect terms in respective categories.
7) Run catpol.py
    This calculates polarities of the aspect category.
8) finally run makeXML.py
    This collects all the extracted data and combines them to an xml file in the same format as the test file.
